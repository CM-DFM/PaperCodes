The codes of paper &lt;Cross-modal data fusion management and privacy protection for data analysis in IoT>

We present cross-modal data fusion management (CM-Dedup), a novel data managemeng model capable of manage data of any input modalities synchronously, such as text, image, video, or audio. Unlike existing data management systems, CM-Dedup can manage the fusion of data in multiple modalities, and its inputs are not limited to fixed modal subsets such as text or images. To save storage space and improve storage efficiency, we propose to latent align cross-modal data in the feature vector space and store only shared feature vectors to maximize storage space savings. This allows CM-Dedup enables efficient storage management of input data of any modality and can recover data with the help of feature vectors. CM-Dedup employs a novel composable management strategy, i.e., a shared multimodal space is established by latent alignment during feature extraction, which enables simultaneous management of intertwined modalities. CoDi is highly flexible, enabling strong joint modal management capabilities and cross-modal data synthesis, thus providing more data resources for subsequent data analysis.
